## Types of Uncertainty
Aleatoric uncertainty is uncertainty due to statistical randomness, epistemic uncertainty is uncertainty due to limited knowledge or ignorance in the collected data, entropy is the sum of aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, vacuity is uncertainty due to a lack of evidence, and dissonance is is uncertainty due to conflicting evidence. 
## Model and Dataset
The model I used for this project can be found at https://github.com/bfortuner/pytorch_tiramisu. I modified and added to it to suit my needs. The dataset I used for this project can be found at https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial/tree/master/CamVid.
